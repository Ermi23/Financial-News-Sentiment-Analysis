# Financial-News-Sentiment-Analysis
This project focuses on the detailed analysis of a large corpus of financial news data to discover correlations between news sentiment and stock market movements.

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing financial news headlines to assess sentiment and correlate these sentiments with stock price movements. The objective is to uncover actionable insights that can improve financial forecasting accuracy and inform investment strategies.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation
Financial news datasets containing headlines, publication dates, and associated stock symbols are gathered and prepared for analysis.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are applied to quantify the sentiment expressed in financial news headlines. Sentiment scores are generated to understand the emotional context surrounding news related to specific stocks.
